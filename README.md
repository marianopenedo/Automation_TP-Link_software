# Automation_TP-Link_software
## TP-Link router configuration process automation software
This work should demonstrate the development of a software that aims to automate the configuration process of TP-Link routers. The purpose of this is to make the router configuration process easier and more accessible. It is explained through diagrams and the programming itself, with the help of the text.
Knowing that TP-Link is one of the most active, well-known and producer brands in the router market, it was chosen because of the number of devices of this brand in circulation in the market.
The software was developed with Python, Selenium and Regex technologies, the main mechanism being the browser automation tool, responsible for performing the main activity of the system.
